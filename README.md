# AI_DS_ML_Journey

Welcome to my personal journey transitioning from a **Software Engineer** to an aspiring **AI/ML/Data Scientist**. This repo will be continuously updated with daily progress, code, notes, and projects.

## 🗓️ Plan Overview
**Daily**: LeetCode + Stratascratch + 1 Kaggle notebook  
**Weekly**: 1 structured project from DataCamp / fast.ai / ProjectPro  
**Monthly**: Publish blog/write-up on GitHub/Medium
