## Model Performance: Convergence Check
We used Gradient Descent to optimize the parameters. The graph below shows the cost function ($J(\theta)$) decreasing over iterations, confirming that the learning rate was tuned correctly.

*Observation: The loss drops exponentially and stabilizes around iteration 200, indicating convergence.*
